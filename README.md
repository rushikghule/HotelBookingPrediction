## ðŸš€ About Project

Imagine you're planning a vacation. You go online to book a hotel, excited about your upcoming trip. But have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes? That's where our project comes in.

We wanted to predict whether customers would cancel their hotel bookings or not. It's like peering into a crystal ball to foresee if someone will change their mind about their stay.

So, the next time you're booking a hotel, remember the magic happening behind the scenes. And know that somewhere out there, a team of data scientists is working to make your stay even better.
